  <p>It is all you would want in a Grand Theft Auto game. Ammu-Nation Stores, Shops, Fast Cars, Strip Clubs, and an array of 3 protagonists, Michael, Franklin and Trevor. The graphics amaze you and make it feel like you are really there, the gameplay is amazing, Online or Story Mode. Online emerges you into a whole other world of GTA. Sky races, fighting other players, constantly updated cars, an array of cool and futuristic weapons along with normal ones from story mode. <br><b>--User</b> </p>

    <p>Probably one of the most fascinating and fun games I’ve ever played and I’ve got about 30 years of gaming experience from Atari to the next gen consoles. This is a must for anyone who even remotely likes action/adventure/puzzle games. I usually go back and play through it once a year and always see something I missed. It honestly reminds me of the Soul Reaver games for some reason and those were some of my favorites as well. <br><br><b>--User</b></p>

    <p>This game is a masterpiece. Watch dogs 2 is highly underrated and I consider it to be one of the gaming greats. A story you get invested in, lovable characters, comedy, action, a surprisingly accurate depiction of San Francisco, decent graphics, advanced NPC interaction to the player and to each other and yet again highly underrated multiplayer modes. This game is quite extraordinary with realistic characters with real seeming emotions unlike other game characters. <br><b>--User</b></p>

    <p>Great game in it's current state. Highly recommend if you like procedurally generated exploration, survival, base building, crafting games with first and third person shooter, flight combat and minor puzzle elements. This game can be played In VR, is single and online multiplayer and is cross platform. When NMS first released it was a very boring lifeless game that could only keep your attention for a short time but now <br>its great. <br><b>--User</b></p>

    <p>I've got a lot of seat-time in several forms of amateur motorsports over the past 15 years, and have been SIM racing for almost that exact same period of time. Not a single title has ever provided an experience as close to reality as that of Assetto Corsa. It's just downright amazing. I'm lucky enough that I pilot in RL a couple classic rear-engined Porsches which are extremely similar to models included in Assetto Corsa, and the "feel" in Assetto Corsa is absolutely spot-on. <br><b>--User</b></p>

    <p>I never thought I would get addicted to a ""click to move"" type of game, but oh boy, Dota 2 has some insane depth and replayability.Each match is different! Community may be harsh and idiotic sometimes, but try to not let that stopping you from playing and enjoying it! It really is the best Free to Play game. It requires you to learn many little things, skills, items, timings etc. You must play for at least 100 hours to get a grip of it, and about 1000h to know a bit of everything. <br><b>--User</b> </p>
